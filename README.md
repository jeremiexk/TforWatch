My solution to a small univerity programming challenge

The Task - 
TouchTimer

Time does not stand still, and as a civilisation, we love nothing more than to measure its flow. The history of the stopwatch is fascinating, dating back to the 17th century, when it was supposedly first used to capture the timings of horse races, and we havenâ€™t stopped capturing measurements of time since.

Despite this, the stopwatch apps that come bundled with phones tend to be spartan affairs, with old-fashioned interfaces. Could they make better use be made of the touchscreen capabilities of our phones?

Your task is to develop a stopwatch app with no buttons, that only takes input through gestures. For example simple functions would be start the stopwatch with a tap anywhere, whereby the count will increase every second, and stop it with another tap anywhere. In addition to counting up, we might also want to be able to count down by setting timers: a swipe to the right will move the seconds forward in respect to the velocity of the swipe, and similarly, the seconds will be rewound by swiping to the left (this may also affect the minutes displayed). A swipe up will increment the minutes shown on the timer in respect to the velocity, and a swipe down will decrement the minutes displayed also. If we do alter the time using a swipe motion, then we must assume that we want to set a particular time to count down from, in which case, the time will decrease every second when we tap the screen to start the timer. The time recorded must also be able to be reset back to zero, by performing a pinch gesture (like when you use maps).
